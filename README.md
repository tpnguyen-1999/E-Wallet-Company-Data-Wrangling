# [PYTHON] E-Wallet Company Data Wrangling & Exploratory Analysis
Using Python to perform Data Wrangling and EDA on an E-Wallet company dataset.

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to analyze important datasets from an E-wallet company to uncover valuable business insights. The primary goal is to explore payment volumes, product information, and transaction patterns using the following datasets:
- payment_report.csv: Includes monthly payment volumes for different products, offering insights into the performance of each product over time
- product.csv: provides detailed product information, including IDs, categories, and team ownership, allowing for a thorough analysis of product segments
- transactions.csv: Contains transaction details, such as timestamps, amounts, and product IDs, enabling a detailed analysis of customer behavior and transaction trends

There are two main parts in this project:
- Part I: EDA\
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) includes merging and cleaning the payment and product datasets, detecting missing values, duplicates, incorrect data types, and ensuring overall data quality.
- Part II: Data Wrangling\
Data Wrangling focuses on extracting key insights, such as identifying top-performing products, evaluating team performance, and classifying various transaction types, including refunds and transfers. The goal is to derive actionable insights from the datasets to support better decision-making.
